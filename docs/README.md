New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 11. This example
copies [Mike Bostock's click-to-zoom via transform block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590) and
wires it up with the Rhode Island district shape file. The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization
were created by me using [shape files](https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/) provided by the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
